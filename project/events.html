                    <h1>The Floyd Cardoz Scholarship</h1>
                <br>Chef Floyd believed that the way to evolve as a chef and a human being was to constantly and 
                consistently help, inspire, mould, guide, and listen to those around him. <br>

                <br>Inspired by Chef Floyd's life and to commemorate his love for mentorship and teaching, <br>
                <br>we have partnered with the Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration (WGSHA), <br> 
                <br>Manipal to carry his legacy forward. Our aim through this scholarship is to help aspiring <br>
                <br>chefs receive the knowledge and skills they need for a better future.

                <br>Donations towards the Floyd Cardoz Scholarship will aid Jeeva to complete his culinary programme 
                at WGSHA thereby opening up fruitful opportunities for his future.
